# Data Science Bootcamp project 

This is my first small immersiv project of the Data Science bootcamp at [neuefisch](https://www.neuefische.de/) Germany form 2020. 

The goal her is to use King County House Sales data set for a self imagent business case in the context of house price prediction.

in this case the business is Urban Farming Club a club that has HQ and members that just Farm for fun and master farmers that own houses and big lots close to the city and from the perspective of going to King County with this venture the county is probed for HQ and price estimation by means of basic linear regression model and some data filtering and visualisation.
